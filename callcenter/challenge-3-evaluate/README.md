# Challenge 3: Evaluate

Time: ~30 minutes

## Objectives

By the end of this challenge, you will have:

- ✅ Run a systematic evaluation of your agents against a test dataset
- ✅ Used built-in evaluators (coherence, relevance) to measure quality
- ✅ Interpreted evaluation metrics and identified areas for improvement
- ✅ Understanding of how to integrate evaluations into a CI/CD pipeline

Time: ~30 minutes

## Context

Monitoring tells you **what's happening** (latency, errors, token usage). Evaluation tells you **if the classifications are actually correct**.

You have a dataset of 10 test cases — each with a call scenario and the expected correct classification (intent, priority, sentiment, recommended action). You'll run your agents against these test cases and measure how well they perform using LLM-as-judge scoring.

## Why Evaluate?

Monitoring tells you your agents are *running* — evaluation tells you they're doing the *right thing*. These are fundamentally different questions.

Monitoring captures **operational signals**: latency, token count, error rates, uptime. These tell you *how* the system behaves mechanically. Evaluation captures **quality signals**: are the agent's outputs correct, relevant, coherent, and consistent with expected outcomes? These tell you *whether* the system is actually doing its job.

Without systematic evaluation, you're relying on spot-checks — reading a handful of responses and judging them subjectively. This doesn't scale, isn't repeatable, and can't catch regressions when you update a prompt or switch models. Evaluation gives you a measurable baseline: a score you can track over time and compare across versions.

Evaluation also surfaces issues that monitoring is blind to. An agent that always responds quickly and without errors but consistently misclassifies intent — or gives scripted resolutions that don't match the customer's actual situation — looks perfectly healthy to monitoring. Evaluation catches it immediately.

For production AI, evaluations should run:

- **Before deployment** — establish a quality baseline and gate releases on minimum scores
- **After any change** — to system prompts, models, tools, or retrieval data
- **On a schedule** — to detect drift as the underlying model updates or call patterns shift

For the NovaTel call center specifically: an agent that classifies CALL-007 (suspected account hack) as a billing dispute is dangerous — it's a security incident that needs immediate escalation. Monitoring sees a successful, low-latency response. Only evaluation — comparing the output against the expected classification — catches the mistake.

## The Evaluation Dataset

The dataset lives at [challenge-4-deploy/evaluation_dataset.json](../challenge-4-deploy/evaluation_dataset.json) — it contains:

- 10 call scenarios covering all 6 intent types
- Each has an `input` (call summary you send to the agent)
- Each has an `expected_output` (the correct classification and action)

## About the Evaluators

Microsoft Foundry uses an **LLM-as-judge** approach — a separate model reads each agent response alongside the input and ground truth, then scores it on a 1–5 scale. You’ll use two built-in evaluators:

- **Coherence** — measures whether the agent’s response is logically structured and internally consistent. A score of 5 means the output is clear, well-organised, and flows naturally. A low score means the response is contradictory, jumbled, or hard to follow. For a call centre agent this catches things like recommending an upsell while simultaneously classifying the intent as a cancellation risk.

- **Relevance** — measures whether the response actually addresses what was asked. A score of 5 means the agent identified the right intent and gave a pertinent resolution recommendation. A low score means the agent went off-topic, missed key signals in the call summary, or gave a generic script that doesn’t match the customer’s situation.

These two scores together give you a quick signal on output quality. When you see a low coherence score, look at the agent’s system prompt structure. When you see a low relevance score, look at how the agent uses the call context and what information it’s not picking up on.

## Get Started

The evaluation dataset has already been prepared for you as [eval_portal.jsonl](./eval_portal.jsonl) — 10 call scenarios ready to upload.

---

### Step 1: Open the Evaluation tab

1. Go to the [Microsoft Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/nextgen) → your project
2. On the top bar → **Build** → **Evaluations** → **Create**

### Step 2: Configure the evaluation

3. Select **Agent** as the evaluation target
4. Choose `intent-classification-agent` from the dropdown
5. Select **Existing Dataset**
6. Upload `callcenter/challenge-3-evaluate/eval_portal.jsonl`
7. Map the `query` column to the agent input field → **Next** and leave **gpt-5.4** as the Judge model

### Step 3: Choose evaluators

8. Enable **Coherence** and **Relevance** → **Next**
9. Click **Submit**

### Step 4: View results

Results appear in the **Evaluate** tab within a few minutes. Click the run name to see per-row scores and the aggregate metric summary.
